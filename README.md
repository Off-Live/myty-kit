# MYTY Kit

## MYTY

Our goal is to help our users become **mighty** by setting themselves free from constraints imposed by reality. 

Project MYTY introduces **Open Standard for Social Metaverse**, and creates a network effect among the “Metaverses”. In turn, MYTY helps Metaverses to benefit from this network effect by providing various products both on-chain and off-chain.

## MYTY Kit

MYTY Kit is an **Open Avatar Development Kit for Social Metaverse**. As the first product of MYTY ecosystem, it helps Avatar Creators (PFP projects and community artists) to turn their beloved PFPs into MYTY Avatars. Unlike original JPEG images, MYTY Avatars can be animated and utilize motion capture technology to express users’ emotions.

Also, it allows for Metaverse Creators to build PFP-based Metaverse apps and services using MYTY Avatars. We believe that Social Metaverse will emerge from Web3 culture where people build their multi-persona using expressive avatars.

### What can I do with MYTY Kit?

At this time, MYTY Kit provides followings:

- Convert 10K PFPs into animated and motion-tracking avatars (referred to as MYTY avatar) within a week
- Make your MYTY Avatars accessible to any Metaverse Creators in order to increase utility to your Avatars and their users
- Build an application featured with MYTY Avatars, which is continuously added.
- Deploy your application powered by MYTY Kit on multi-platforms such as Windows, macOS, Web, iOS, and Android


>💡 MYTY Kit currently only supports 2D avatars but we have a plan to expand our scope to 3D.


### What are the examples of Social Metaverse?

We do not want to limit your imagination. Any social activities in the physical world can be converted into Metaverse services based on MYTY Avatars. We expect/believe following activities are possible in Social Metaverse:



> 💡 The basic assumption here is that users are already verified by their crypto wallets and can access MYTY Avatars that are connected to their NFT
